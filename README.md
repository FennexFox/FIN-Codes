# FIN-Codes
Some randome Ficsit-Netowork projects I use in my Satisfactory playthrough

## BasicLibraries
Some useful libraries like unit conversion, vanilla sign control and etc.

## LogisticsControl
I wanted to keep track of non-belt logistics, so I tried to code some control systems and its database. I need some more time to figure out what to do.

## AdaptiveProduction
The biggest problem with using non-belt logistics is dealing with variable throughput. With these codes, I want to adaptively adjust the production rate based on input and output inventory so that no production line runs out of material.
