# FIN-Codes
Some randome Ficsit-Netowork projects I use in my Satisfactory playthrough

## FicsitOS<sup>tm</sup>
Some Out-Of-Box<sup>tm</sup> OS-thingy, primariliy comes with a bsic blueprint-thingy for standard IO terminal with CLI and Package Installer to import some libary-thingies from online(this github, maybe?) or from mainframe of your factory, to reduce ad-hoc implementations all over the factories and efficient installations on new production sites. Might be a fork of [this resource](https://discord.com/channels/735877487808086088/735879752522399804/1259111023093485630)?

## BasicLibraries<sup>OOD</sup>
Some useful libraries like unit conversion, vanilla sign control and etc. Need to be updated to use Structs and other stuffs.

## SmartRoads
I wanted to keep track of non-belt logistics, so I tried to code some control systems and its database. It will be heavily dependent on road props, such as street lights in patterns to monitor traffics; thus "SmartRoads". Renamed from "LogisticsControl".

## ElevatorSystem
The primary purpose is to lock the elevator door when the cabin is not at the floor, so you won't fall off. Secondary purposes are to make a nice-looking, practical and easy-to-build interface console and indicators. Primary goal is done, working on secondary.

## AdaptiveProduction
It has revived, but with much simpler and smaller goal. It's primary purpose is automatically cycle through multiple recipes with same output, such as alien proteins or biomass, without wasting minimum time and resources.
